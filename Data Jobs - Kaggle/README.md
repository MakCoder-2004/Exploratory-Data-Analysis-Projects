# Data Jobs Analysis

**Dataset Source:** https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores job market data for data-related roles. The analysis is divided into four main stages:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Skills Demand Analysis**
3. **Skills Trend Analysis**
4. **Salary and Compensation Analysis**

Each stage is documented in separate Jupyter notebooks, with visualizations and insights to better understand hiring and salary trends in the data industry.

## 🔍 Notebooks Description

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (01.EDA.ipynb)**

* Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
* Explored distributions of job titles, companies, locations, and salaries
* Identified missing values and handled outliers
* Generated summary statistics and visualized key patterns

### 2. **Skills Demand Analysis (02.SkillsDemand.ipynb)**

* Extracted skills required for different job postings
* Analyzed frequency of technical and soft skills
* Highlighted top skills in demand for Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers
* Created visualizations (bar plots, word clouds, etc.) to showcase demand

### 3. **Skills Trend Analysis (03.SkillsTrend.ipynb)**

* Tracked the demand for specific skills over time
* Compared popularity of programming languages, tools, and frameworks
* Identified rising and declining skills in the job market
* Produced trend visualizations to support findings

### 4. **Salary and Compensation Analysis (04.SalaryAnalysis.ipynb)**

* Analyzed salary distributions across roles and locations
